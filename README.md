# Learning project
Hey guys! I m new to programming, well I don t know if I can say new, but somewhere there.
I come with some knowledge about html,css, a little javascript and python.

I started this repository to start understanding how github works and as a new learning tool.

## 100 days of coding
I decided to start this challenge so it will keep me motivated. I started with a udemy python course and I love it.
### Day 1
- started python
- learned print,input,strings and made a repl.it account where I wrote my code
- made a Band Name Generator that combines two inputs to make a band name
### Day 2
- learned all types of variables
- learned to convert them
- made a Tip Calculator where I split the bill to x people with a y% of a tip
### Day 3
- learned booleans
- I think I learned to perfections the if elif else conditions also the and or and not
- made a story driven game - choose your story baiscly, built with a lot of if and else statements
